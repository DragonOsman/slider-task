## Javascript.info Slider Task - "Drag'n'Drop Chapter"

This is my solution on the "Slider" task in the javascript.info chapter "Drag'n'Drop".  The code for the x coordinate calculation for when the user moves their mouse when dragging the slider was taken from the javascript.info site owner's solution (just that part only, though).
